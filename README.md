# Autonomous Parking and Reverse using Reinforcement Learning 🚗🅿️

This repository contains the code, simulation framework, and evaluation results for the research paper:

**"Dynamic Grid Navigation for Autonomous Driving: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Self-Parking and Reversing"**

Submitted to *EVOS* (Elsevier) Journal, 2025.

## 🔍 Overview

This project presents a modified Q-learning method combined with RRT and MPC to enable autonomous vehicles to perform precise parking and reversing maneuvers in dynamic grid environments.

### Core Features
- Modified tabular Q-learning with:
  - ✅ Adaptive exploration
  - ✅ Lookahead obstacle prediction
  - ✅ Priority-based updates
- Hybrid architecture with:
  - 🧭 RRT for path planning
  - 🧠 MPC for smooth trajectory tracking
- Simulation of dynamic 2D grid with obstacles and moving targets
